    description: "The original GMC Terrain was a compact/mid-size crossover SUV that shared its platform with the Chevrolet Equinox but featured distinctive, squared-off styling with prominent fender flares and a bold front fascia. Initially powered by either a 2.4L four-cylinder engine or a 3.0L V6 (later upgraded to a 3.6L), it offered front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The interior was more upscale than its Chevrolet counterpart, with higher quality materials and a premium design, particularly in the Denali trim introduced in 2013. Notable features included a sliding and reclining rear seat that could move nearly eight inches to prioritize either passenger or cargo space. A significant refresh in 2016 updated the styling and technology offerings. This generation established the Terrain as GMC's entry-level crossover with more rugged styling and premium positioning compared to its platform mate."

    description: "The current Terrain features more car-like styling with a floating roof design, slimmer headlights, and C-shaped lighting elements that align with GMC's design language. Significantly smaller than its predecessor, it moved firmly into the compact crossover segment. Engine options initially included 1.5L and 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinders plus a 1.6L turbodiesel (discontinued after 2019), all paired with advanced transmissions featuring an unusual electronic precision shifter replaced by conventional controls in later model years. The interior offers a modern design with improved materials and technology, including an available 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Trim levels continue to include the premium Denali with distinctive styling elements and luxury features, and the AT4 was added in 2022 with rugged styling cues, though without significant off-road mechanical upgrades. A refresh for 2022 updated the styling with a more aggressive front end, enhanced technology, and expanded safety features. This generation refines the Terrain's position as a premium-positioned compact crossover that emphasizes styling, technology, and interior quality over off-road capability or maximum utility."
